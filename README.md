# Huddle - Styled Components Project

 JSX - Styled Components 


This project, comes with the main purpose of demonstrate some techniques of development regarding the use of styled components in react projects, although small, it's a good start to understand the organization, some best practices and thinking in "styling components" in the most efficient way.

Implementation of logic in our development serves a big part of the journey on whether you are able to merge and find the sweet spot between logic concepts/principles and design/principles.
